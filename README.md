# shopping-list-app
This is my shopping list app.
I asked chatGpt to give me the process of building this app and here is the process:


 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 1: Plan the App Features**
Before writing any code, define what the app should do:
- Add items to a shopping list
- Display the list of items
- Delete individual items
- (Optional) Mark items as bought
- (Optional) Store the list in local storage to persist after refresh

 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 2: Design the Layout (HTML Structure)**
Sketch or outline the structure:
- A title/header
- An input field for item name
- A button to add the item
- A list area to display items
- (Optional) Buttons/icons next to each item to delete or mark it


 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 3: Style the App (CSS Styling)**
Decide how the app should look:
- Center the app on the screen
- Style the input and button (size, color, hover effect)
- Style the list (borders, padding, spacing)
- Use different colors or effects for bought items
- Make it responsive (optional)


 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 4: Add Functionality (JavaScript Logic)**
Set up the basic JavaScript behaviors:
1. **Capture user input** when the add button is clicked.
2. **Validate input** (e.g., no empty items).
3. **Create and display a new list item** in the UI.
4. **Handle delete actions** for each item.
5. (Optional) **Toggle bought/not bought** state on item click.
6. (Optional) **Save and load items** using `localStorage`.


 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 5: Connect HTML with JavaScript**
Use DOM methods to:
- Get elements (input, button, list)
- Listen to events (clicks, form submission)
- Manipulate the DOM (create, append, remove items)

 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 6: Test the App**
Try the following:
- Add multiple items
- Try empty input (should not add)
- Delete items
- Refresh the page (check if local storage works)
- Test on different devices/screen sizes

 ðŸ”¹ **STEP 7: Polish and Improve**
Consider enhancements:
- Add item categories or quantities
- Sort items alphabetically
- Add a clear-all button
- Add animations or transitions
- Allow editing of list items
